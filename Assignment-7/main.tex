\begin{frame}{Problem}
    \begin{block}{Ex 2.27}
        We have two coins; the first is fair and the second two-headed. We pick one of the coins
        at random, we toss it twice and heads shows both times. Find the probability that the coin
        picked is fair.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Solution}
    \begin{block}{Solution:}
        Acoording to Bayes' theorem for two events A \& B:
        \begin{equation}
            P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
        \end{equation}
        Using Bayes' theorem:\\
            P(coin picked is fair) = $\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}+2 \times \frac{1}{2}+1} = \frac{1}{9}$
